Bird Quest is a New Zealand themed puzzle-platformer. You are a mother Pukeku and your chick has wandered off. Your job is to explore the area, avoiding danger and solving puzzles along the way until you find him. But your chick is still not safe! He needs to be guided back to the nest where you can keep an eye on him until the next time he wanders off.


INSTRUCTIONS:

WASD / arrow keys = movement
Space / W / up arrow = jumping
C = toggle your chick following you (has a range)
R = reset to last checkpoint
Escape / pause button = bring up options menu


KNOWN ISSUES:

=> Blocks and characters will sometimes still get stuck on tile colliders
